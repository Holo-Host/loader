# Holo.host Loader Tools

hQuery is a js module handling network connections with HoloPorts. For the closed Alpha release it is only responsible for establishing connection from browser to HoloPort and handling errors gracefully.

Test sites:

- https://hello.artflow.network - will return working hApp (proto, if no results are returned then probably hcdev server died)
