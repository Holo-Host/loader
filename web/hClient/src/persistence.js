 *
 * Interfaces with the browser local store to persist keybundles and host addresses
 *
 * The local store schema is as follows:
 *
 * localStorage: {
 *     <hAppId>: {
 *         <hostAddress>: {keyBundle: <bundle object>, canWrite: true|false},
 *         ... other hosts for this hApp
 *     },
 *     ... other hApps
 * }
 *
 * Host addresses are stored with the keyBundle that has been used on that host (if any).
 * There should be only a single active key pair used per host which may be readonly.
 *
 * @param      {<type>}  hAppId  The application identifier
 * @return     {string}  The or generate canWrite key.
