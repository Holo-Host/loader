# Holo.host Loader Tools

This is Pre-Alpha software only for testing purposes.

This is a repository of the JavaScript tools which run on initial load of a web application running on Holo.Host P2P infrastructure.

 1. [hololoader.js](hololoader/hololoader.js): Reads the HTTP Host entered into the browser address bar, then calls a service to translate that domain name into the Holochain application ID that you're trying to reach.
 2. [Holo.js](holo/holo.js): Starts talking to P2P Holo hosts to load your application components.
