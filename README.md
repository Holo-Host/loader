# Holo.host Loader Tools

Test branch PJs_v3

In this release entire js code lives inside hQuery.js. It still needs some work (a lot of TODOs).

I hard-coded a few test sites:

- http://test1.imagexchange.pl - will return regular app
- http://test2.imagexchange.pl - will return working hApp (proto, if no results are returned then probably hcdev server died)
- http://test3.imagexchange.pl - will return error (no entries in tranche)
- http://test4.imagexchange.pl - will return error (no entries in url2dna)

And check out an error page that pops up :-)

Happy testing :-)
